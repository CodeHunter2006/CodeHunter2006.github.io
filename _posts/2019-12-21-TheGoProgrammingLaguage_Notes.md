# Preface

As Rob Pike put it, "complexity is multiplicative": fixing a problem by making one part of the system more complex slowly but surely adds complexity to other parts.

# 1. Turorial

Package main is special. It defines a standalone executable program, not a library. Within package main the function main is also special—it’s where execution of the program begins.

- PS: but the folder name may not named 'main'.

In effect, new lines following certain tokens are converted into semicolons, so where newlines are placed matters to proper parsing of Go code.
